COPYWRITING
CONTENT WRITERS WITH TRADITION AND DIGITAL SKILLS.
Copy may be writing, but copywriting isn’t just about words. It’s about playing with ideas. 
Whether it’s the instructions for a sex toy or the inauguration speech for a president, copywriters 
create meaning, deliver a message, and call an audience to action.

Writing seems like a solitary pursuit. It isn’t here. At Umuzi, 
you’ll learn to work in a team, often with a designer, sometimes a strategist, 
and always with your target audience top of mind. You’ll use empathy to understand the 
audience you’re trying to reach, define their problems, come up with ideas, prototype, and 
test them, using our Design Thinking process.

Where to next? Many of our alumni turn to advertising, working for top agencies and 
brands, en route to becoming Creative Directors. Copywriters are employed by agencies 
both permanently and on a freelance basis to develop advertising concepts. Agency 
copywriters usually work in close partnership with art directors and have lots of input 
to the visual elements. Another option is to move into the world of content creation, writing 
for online publications. Increasingly copywriters are also essential to Tech Product Teams, in 
the software and game development space, to script user journeys and user interfaces. They deliver 
the words and verbal content that accompanies the visual elements.
