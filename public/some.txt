COPYWRITING 📚
CONTENT WRITERS WITH TRADITION AND DIGITAL SKILLS.

Copy may be writing, but copywriting isn’t just about words. 
It’s about playing with ideas. Whether it’s the instructions for a sex toy or the inauguration 
speech for a president, copywriters create meaning, deliver a message, and call an audience to action.

Writing seems like a solitary pursuit. It isn’t here. At Umuzi, you’ll learn to work in a team,
often with a designer, sometimes a strategist, and always with your target audience top of mind. 
You’ll use empathy to understand the audience you’re trying to reach, define their problems, come up with ideas, 
prototype, and test them, using our Design Thinking process.

Where to next? Many of our alumni turn to advertising, working for top agencies and brands, 
en route to becoming Creative Directors. Copywriters are employed by agencies both permanently 
and on a freelance basis to develop advertising concepts. Agency copywriters usually work in close 
partnership with art directors and have lots of input to the visual elements. Another option is to 
move into the world of content creation, writing for online publications. Increasingly copywriters 
are also essential to Tech Product Teams, in the software and game development space, to script user
journeys and user interfaces. They deliver the words and verbal content that accompanies the visual elements.

Imagine where this career could take you. Now write your story.
