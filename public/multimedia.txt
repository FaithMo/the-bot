MULTIMEDIA CONTENT PRODUCTION
STORYTELLERS SPECIALISING IN EITHER VIDEOGRAPHY OR MOTION GRAPHICS.
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, is a story. Whether you’re sitting around a fire 
or watching the latest Hollywood blockbuster, storytelling is our most powerful means of communication. 
The skill of storytelling is increasingly in demand as organisations realise its power to connect and communicate.

Today’s storytellers play with a variety of mediums from video, motion graphics, animation, and even 
interactive games, to develop rich, focused narratives.

Your career can go anywhere from Researcher, Production Assistant, to Video Editor, Cinematographer, 
Motion Graphic Designer all the way to Director or Producer. Or an all-round, kick-ass Freelancer Generalist.

Regardless of the specific career path you choose, the core multimedia storytelling skills we focus 
on provide a solid base for growth. We explore various forms of storytelling from creative to 
documentary using Design Thinking as our process.
